# Technical Approach - Smart Recipe Generator

## Architecture Overview

The application is built with React and uses a component-based structure. It employs custom hooks for managing state and service layers for handling data. The focus is on performance, accessibility, and user experience.

## Key Technical Decisions

### Recipe Matching Algorithm
- A multi-factor scoring system considers exact matches, partial matches, and substitutions.
- Ingredient normalization improves matching accuracy by handling plurals and variations.
- Weighted scoring assigns values: Exact matches (100%), partial matches (80%), substitutions (60%).
- Bonus scoring rewards ingredient usage efficiency and recipe complexity.

### Image Recognition
- A mock implementation is ready for real AI/ML integration (e.g., Spoonacular, Google Vision).
- File validation and compression tools ensure optimal performance.
- Error handling includes user-friendly fallbacks and retry options.
- Progress indicators enhance user experience during processing.

### Data Management
- A local JSON database features over 22 diverse recipes across various cuisines and dietary needs.
- Integration with localStorage saves user preferences, ratings, and favorites.
- A modular service layer simplifies API integration and data abstraction.
- Efficient caching is in place with performance monitoring and optimization.

### Performance Optimizations
- Component-level CSS improves maintainability and load performance.
- Lazy loading is set up for images and components.
- Debounced search reduces unnecessary API calls and boosts responsiveness.
- Memoized calculations are used for intensive tasks like nutrition calculations.

### User Experience
- The design follows a mobile-first approach with touch-optimized interactions.
- Accessibility features include ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and support for screen readers.
- The application supports progressive enhancement, allowing for graceful degradation of unsupported features.
- Loading states and error boundaries improve the overall user experience.
